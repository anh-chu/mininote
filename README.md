A simple, self-hosted, encrypted Markdown note-taking app built with [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org), and [Express](http://expressjs.com). Check out the **[hosted demo](https://apps.muetsch.io/mininote)**!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
* NodeJS >= `22.12.0 LTS`

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to run?
**üí° Since version 1.0.0, TLS encryption is mandatory for hosts other than `localhost`, as required for `window.crypto.subtle` (see [#73](https://github.com/muety/mininote/issues/73#issuecomment-1057782171)).**

When either only using MiniNote locally or running it behind a reverse proxy, which terminates TLS instead, you can leave out the HTTPS / TLS part of the setup. 

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/muety/mininote

# 2. Install backend dependencies
$ yarn

# 3. Install frontend dependencies and build
$ cd webapp && yarn && yarn build && cd ..

# 4. Obtain or create a TLS certifiate
# See https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/create-a-self-signed-tls-certificate/
# Skip for localhost or with reverse proxy

# 4. Set environment variables for TLS cert and key
# Skip for localhost or with reverse proxy
$ export HTTPS_CERT='path/to/your/mininote.crt'
$ export HTTPS_KEY='path/to/your/mininote.key'

# Run
$ yarn start
```

## üê≥ How to run with Docker?
```bash
# 1. Obtain or create TLS certificate (see above)

# 2. Create a persistent volume
$ docker volume create mininote-data

# 3. Run the container
$ docker run \
    -d \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -v mininote-data:/app/data \
    -v path/to/your/mininote.crt:/etc/mininote.crt:ro \
    -v path/to/your/mininote.key:/etc/mininote.key:ro \
    -e HTTPS_CERT=/etc/mininote.crt \
    -e HTTPS_KEY=/etc/mininote.key \
    --name mininote \
    ghcr.io/muety/mininote:latest
```

## üîí Encryption
MiniNote features encryption, i.e. every note's title and content are encrypted on the client-side (i.e. in your browser) using symmetric AES-GCM provided by the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). However, a notebook's password is used to derive the encryption key. That is, encryption is [only as strong as your password](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/42538/is-password-based-aes-encryption-secure-at-all). Moreover, although notes are sent to the server encryptedly, this cannot be considered _true_ end-to-end encryption, since the server technically has a chance to log your password the moment you create a new notebook in the first place. MiniNote aims for a decent level of security, but does not claim to be NSA-proof.
